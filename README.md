Leaf's cookie module provides a wrapper around the built-in PHP cookie functions. It provides a cleaner and more expressive API working with cookies while maintaining full compatibility with PHP's built-in cookie functions.

## Installation

You can easily install Leaf using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

```bash
composer require leafs/cookie
```

## Usage

Once installed, it merges with Leaf's core, so you can use it like so:

```php
response()
  ->withCookie('name', 'Fullname')
  ->withCookie('age', 20)
  ->json([
      'message' => 'Cookies set'
    ]);
```

Or on its own:

```php
cookie()->set('name', 'Fullname', [
  'expire' => time() + 3600,
  'path' => '/',
  'domain' => 'example.com',
  'secure' => true,
  'httponly' => true,
  'samesite' => 'None'
]);
```
