Leaf's core http functionality packaged as a serve-yourself module. Although seperated from Leaf core, it is still part of the default initial installation and doesn't need to be installed manually (unless you want a particular version).

## Installation

You can easily install Leaf using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

```bash
composer require leafs/cookie
```
